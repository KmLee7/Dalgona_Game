# Dalgona Game (Ppopgi)
#### Dalgona Game is a 2D game where you have to cut out the carved symbols(shape) on the dalgona candy. One of the games I used to play in Korea as a young kid and it became more known after it was played in Squid Game (Korean Netflix Drama). Dalgona game will have variety of difficulties ('normal', 'hard' and  'im_possible'(depending if I can make the shape)). The game will be played with just a mouse and you can cut the out carved lines by clicking on your left click on your mouse. It will have certain amount of percentage you have to complete in certain amount time. This game aims to replicate an experience of Ppopgi that was played on Squid Game.
