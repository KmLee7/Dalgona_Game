# Dalgona Game (Ppopgi)
#### Dalgona Game is a 2D game where you have to cut out the carved symbols(shape) on the dalgona candy. One of the games I used to play in Korea as a young kid and it became more known after it was played in Squid Game (Korean Netflix Drama). Dalgona game will have variety of difficulties ('normal', 'hard' and  'im_possible'(depending if I can make the shape)). The game will be played with just a mouse and you can cut the out carved lines by clicking on your left click on your mouse. It will have certain amount of percentage you have to complete in certain amount time. This game aims to replicate an experience of Ppopgi that was played on Squid Game.

  * Brainstorming of the javascript logic.
  * Getting the basic html outline of the game set up.
  * Figuring out how I'll create the shapes in html 5 canvas.

* Monday:
  * Implement on how to have a background picture of Dalgona on top of canvas shape lines
  * Implement on how to calculate the percentage of completion based on if the user went over the canvas shape curved lines.
  * Implement on how to set up a timer and how it's going to render game-over page when timer hits 0:00 or stops the timer when the user wins.
  * Implement on how to calculate the score based on percentage of completion and how much time is left.

* Tuesday:
  * Focus on Dalgona shape level canvas and users mouse coordination.

* Wednesday:
  * Dedicate this day on putting all the pieces together.
  * After focus on designing the game page.
  * Play and Debug.

* Thursday:
  * Deploy to Github pages.
